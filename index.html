                <h3>How We Met:</h3>
                <p>It all began with friendship! At first, he would make it a point to pass by me and say "hi" to me.
                    Rather it was in the hall while on break or on the call center floor where we worked together. 
                    He sat the opposite direction and a few rows over from me. Then we were both put into training together for a new product.
                    This is were we began to have breaks together and make small converstation.
                    We have known each other now for 10 years and have been together for about 3-4 years.
                    We are still best friends! I feel that I can talk to him just about anything. He constantly makes me laugh. We make a good team together.

                <p>Together Terez and I have 5 kiddos, ranging from 15 years old down to 8years old.</p>
