                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <br>
                I am a mother, daughter, fiancee, full time worker, and a student *LaunchCode CoderGirl!*. 
                Between my fiancee and I, we have a total of 5 kiddos together ages ranging from 15 years old to 8 years old.
                <br>
                I have many goals, but my ultimate professional goal currently is to graduate from LaunchCode. 
                I will use this knowledge and new connections to land my dream job of being in a development role.
                <br>
                Here are some of my photos of my family!

            <p>
                It all started as a development role, one of which wasnt really defined. A development role is an opportunity to help and learn
                a new or different department for a set amount of time, in a sense you are being "borrowed". A part of this agreement was that I
                would take on the maintance of webpage updates.
