                <h2><u>How We Met:</u></h2>
                <p>At first, it was small gestures by saying "hi" or "how are you".
                    Rather it was in the hall or outside while on break or on the call center floor, it seems like we would always see each other. 
                    Then we were both put into the same training for a new product. This is were our friendship really started. 
                    We started having breaks together because of this training. Over the next few years we would talk and text every once and a while
                    keeping in touch. We have a lot in common, from thought process to playing games.
                    We have known each other for 10 years and have been together for 3.5 years. We make a good team together.

                <p>Together Terez and I have 5 kiddos, ranging from 15 years old down to 7 years old.</p>
